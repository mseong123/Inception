# Inception | 42KL

This project aims to broaden knowledge of system administration by using Docker. The subject requires the installation, configuration and set-up of services in docker containers using:
- Dockerfile(s)
- docker-compose
- docker volumes
- docker network
- .env file

### Mandatory
Set up the following services :
 - NGINX
 - Wordpress (php-fpm)
 - MariaDB server

### Bonus
Set up additional services:
 - Redis
 - FTP-server (vsftpd for linux)
 - Server hosting own website (not using php)
 - Adminer
 - Service of your choice (I chose Prometheus which is a container monitoring service which can be accessed using a browser front end client)

*The project requires that we configure the Docker Image <ins>**MANUALLY**</ins> without using ready-made images in docker hub. This requires in-depth understanding of the installation process of the services and relevant config files to make it work!
