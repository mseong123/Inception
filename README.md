This project aims to broaden knowledge of system administration by using Docker. The subject requires the installation, configuration and set-up of services in docker containers using:
- Dockerfile(s)
- docker-compose
- docker volumes
- docker network
- .env environmental variable

### Mandatory
Set up the following services :
 - NGINX
 - Wordpress (phpfpm)
 - MariaDB database

*The project requires that we configure the Docker Image **MANUALLY** without using ready-made images in docker hub. This requires in-depth understanding of the installation process of the services and relevant config files to make it work!
